## Open-Source Contribution toÂ LGM-SOC

>LetsGrowMore is a community of the students, for the students, by the students. LetsGrowMore Summer of Code(LGM SOC) is the open source contribution program which was initiated to enhance the student participation in the open source community and the contribution programs.


Things I like the most about this program is, the eligibility criteria for this program is only that you need to be a student who is enrolled in a graduate program.There were three roles for this program i.e Project admin, Mentor, Participant. I was a participant for this program and the learning curve was really great since this was my first Open Source contribution program. And because of this opportunity, now I'm pretty confident about contributing to a huge code base as well as Bigger projects.

As a participant, I have contributed to 2 open source projects which are as follows: [Web-dev-mini-projects](https://github.com/Ayushparikh-code/Web-dev-mini-projects) and another was [Mirage-UI](https://github.com/ALPHAVIO/Mirage-UI). as I was completely beginner to the open source culture this two projects were best for me to contribute and I really enjoyed contributing to this projects. I am glad to be a part of LGMSOC community, since it helped me a lot and taught many new stuffs.


## Open-Source Contribution to DevIncept DCP'21

>DevIncept is a great community for the students, for the students to grow. And DCP'21 is the open source contribution program which was initiated to enhance the student participation in the open source community and the contribution programs by DevIncept.
